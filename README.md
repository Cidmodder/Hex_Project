# Hex_Project

These files are the scripts that can be applied in unity to generate a hex based grid. This should generate a hex grid that includes grass, desert, water, hills, mountains, resources and towns.

Instalation:
Download each of the CS scripts and import them into Unity version 2022.3.5f1. Create a prefab that is a hexagon and add it into the appropriate prefabs. Attach the scripts to an empty script and press play.

Dependencies:
The road generator uses an A* Pathfinding project to create. All the prefabs are also needed and must be created or imported from other free sources.

Notes:
The scripts need a refactor in order to be more efficient and to full utilize the A* pathfinding script that was added for the roads. The basic functionality is there however.
